# E-Ordinatio
This is my project created using php which aims to arrange the seating and allocate the invigilation duties to teachers in a class room. Very useful for colleges to generate the seating arrangements for exams

E-ORDINATIO is a web based application designed for the colleges.In this
application seating arrangement of the examinations can be generated easily along with the
invigilation duties .The attendence information of the students is available through this. All
students can access their timetable and seating arrangement for the current examination. The
Invigilation duty reports are generated in the order of date, name or duties attented within a
given period through this system, so that the total number of invigilation duties allocated for a
teacher can be calculated easily. The invigilator take attendence of the current examination and
it can be viewed department vise, room vise, subject vise and date vise by both the faculty and
admin thus the number exams attended by a student can be accssed effectively.
The project keeps track of various details in modules such as Students Details, Examination
Timing Details, and Hall Details, Invigilation Details with the proper descriptions
